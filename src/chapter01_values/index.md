# Chapter 1: Values

Numbers such as `7` or `42` are values. A value, as its colloquial meaning implies,
never changes. A `7` will always be a `7`, it would spontaneously become an `8`. The
`8` is a different value. In the following spreadsheet, all the `7`s are the
same. The value appears in three cells, but one of them is not any different than
another one: they are exchangeable.

There are other kinds of values, too. For example, `"Hello"` is a string value, i.e.,
one that does not represent a number, but a text. Again, all `"Hello"`s are the
same, there is no reason to prefer one `"Hello"` over another `"Hello"`.
